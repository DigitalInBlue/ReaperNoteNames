# ReaperNoteNames

A collection of MIDI note name files for the [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). These files help streamline workflow by labeling MIDI notes with instrument or drum names instead of generic note numbers.

## File Naming Convention

All files must follow this strict naming format:

```
<manufacturer>_<instrument>.txt
```

- All lowercase
- No spaces (use underscores `_`)
- Example:  
  - `getgooddrums_architects.txt`  
  - `solemntones_odiniii.txt`

## How to Use

1. Download the `.txt` file for your instrument.
2. Place it in your Reaper MIDI note names directory:

```
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\MIDINoteNames
```

3. In the MIDI Editor, go to **File > Note/CC Names > Load Note/CC Names from File...** and select the file.
